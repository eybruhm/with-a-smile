	Lift your head, baby, don't be scared<br>
    Of the things that could go wrong along the way<br>
    You'll get by with a smile<br>
    You can't win at everything but you can try

    <p style="font-family: Century Gothic">Baby, you don't have to worry<br>
    'Cause there ain't no need to hurry<br>
    No one ever said that there's an easy way<br>
    When they're closing all their doors<br>
    They don't want you anymore<br>
    This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway

    <p style="font-family: Century Gothic">Girl, I'll stay through the bad times<br>
    Even if I have to fetch you everyday<br>
    We'll get by with a smile<br>
    You can never be too happy in this life

    <p style="font-family: Century Gothic">'Cause in a world where everybody<br>
    Hates a happy ending story<br>
    It's a wonder love can make the world go 'round<br>
    But don't let it bring you down<br>
    And turn your face into a frown<br>
    You'll get along with a little prayer and a song

    <p style="font-family: Century Gothic">(Too doo doo...)<br>
    Let me hear you sing it<br>
    (Too doo doo...)
